This project explores the potential degradation of machine learning models given the changing network security landscape, defined by a constant battle between adversaries and network intrusion detection systems, which are adapting to evolving cyber-threats. 

Several deep learning models were used:
1. Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN)
2. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
3. Echo StateNetworks (ESN)
The three models were tested on CSE-CICIDS2018 data set (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html), where the most important features were extracted to enhance detection of denial of service (DoS) attacks.

The performance of the models was evaluated based on accuracy and F1 score.
